Fake News Detector is a ReactJS based web application that provides an easy 
solution to detection of fake news. The web application is focused on 
“oneclick detection” where the user can add text/tweet to determine the 
percentage of truth in the statement. The fake news detection model is trained 
using the datasets; “LIAR: A new benchmark dataset for fake news detection”, 
and a collection of fake tweets from the year 2020. The bot detection model 
is trained using a large dataset of twitter bots. Using the LIAR dataset as 
benchmark, the input text is classified in to the following six categories: true, 
mostly true, half-true, barely true, false and pants fire (complete false). 
Therefore, a six-way classification algorithm is used to categories the user 
given text in to one of the following categories. Upon clicking the one-click 
detection, user lands to the dashboard overview where the result of their query 
is displayed along with the percentage of “truth” in the statement along with 
the result for a user being a bot. The dashboard also provides various graphs, 
widgets and tables for user to explore twitter trends globally, based on their 
location and/or related to their input query. The user can interact with this 
dashboard. A dedicated history tab provides allows user to see their usage 
history.
